# LinearAlgebraProject
Student: Tariq Abufarah.
University : PTUK.
    This was a linear algebra project and my first Python project.
I learned a lot throughout this project, and I think it ended up great, even though my design skills are not that great.
wanted it to be bigger and better, but for now I think it's good enough.
For whoever is reading this ThankYou for trying my project, and if you know me in person, come and say hi.
If you think you can do a better job than me, then go on.
And again, thanks from the heart for reading this, and I hope to see you in another project.
P.S.: You can run it using the .exe, but make sure it's in the same path with the other files.
